# Formula Vehicle Electronics System

Electronics play a critical role in modern vehicles, enhancing performance, driver and passenger comfort, and safety. Following this trend, our team incorporated advanced electronics into our Formula vehicle for the SAE competition. As the team lead, I am pleased to provide a brief overview of one of our major electronic systems: the Pneumatic Gear Shifter.

## Overview of the Pneumatic Gear Shifter

The Pneumatic Gear Shifter is a crucial advancement in Formula vehicles, significantly reducing response time and enhancing overall handling. This allows the driver to focus more on the track, improving performance and safety.

##### Due to the confidential nature of the SAE team project, complete details cannot be disclosed. However, I will provide a concise overview to aid in understanding the Pneumatic Gear Shifter.
